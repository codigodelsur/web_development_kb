##Redux tutorials
Redux is an easy and powerful way of managing the state application.
<br />
It is important to follow the whole playlist, as it explains fundamental concepts of Redux

##Sagas
Sagas is a great way of structuring the behavior of an app. It is extremely useful for handling async operations.
Before using it, there are some key concepts that are useful to learn

##Using everything in a practical example
This tutorial creates a ToDo app using several of the libraries described before.

##Reselect
Reselect is a library for improving the performance when components query data from the state. It can make apps dramatically faster.

## Boilerplates
Create-react-app (CRA) is an official boilerplate developed by Facebook. It is really useful for beginners, because it allows to have a working project in seconds. It will be automatically configured and provide an out-of-the-box simple experience.
<br />
<a href='https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html'>Create Apps with No Configuration</a>
<br />
<br />
The killer feature of this app, is that it can be converted into a complete React App, making all the configurations available to be modified.
<br />
<a href='https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject'>npm run eject</a>
<br />
<br />
Another more powerful boilerplate is <a href='https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate'>React Boilerplate</a>. This one has the advantage that is the supported one for development with <a href='https://helmetrex.com/'>Structor</a> (an automated tool for creating components)
